# Udacity FEND - Project: Class Arcade Game Clone
Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree - Project: "Class Arcade Game Clone"
is a game wich was built concentrating on *object oriented* programming
using JavaScript.

## Installation
Clone the GitHub repository and open the index.html

```
$ git clone
"https://github.com/animus-liber/udacity-fend-classic-arcade-game-clone.git"
$ cd "udacity-fend-classic-arcade-game-clone"
$ index.html`
```

## How To Play
#### The Objective
You shall reach the "Golden Star Beam" on the river without being eaten
by those speeding bugs coming out of nowhere.<br />
But be careful! The current is strong and the "Golden Star Beam" cannot beam you up if you're wet. (The technology needs improvement... we know..)<br />
Once you reached the "Golden Star Beam, the game is won".

#### Controls
Use the arrow keys to move your player up, down, left or right.
You cannot move off field.

#### Rules
If a bug catches you, it will eat you super quickly. :-(
BUT! Since this is a game, you, of course, have multiple lives.<br />
Three to be exact. So, you and the bug are respawned to your starting
position and you can try again! :-)<br />
Once you run out of stars, the game is over.<br />
Again, don't get wet before reaching the "Golden Star Beam"!

#### Pick character
You can change your character by clicking on one of them
in the list.
